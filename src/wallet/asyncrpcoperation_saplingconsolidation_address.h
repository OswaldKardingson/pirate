/**
 * @file asyncrpcoperation_saplingconsolidation_address.h
 * @brief Asynchronous RPC operation for consolidating Sapling notes to a single address
 * 
 * This file defines the AsyncRPCOperation_saplingconsolidation_address class, which implements
 * an asynchronous operation for consolidating multiple small Sapling notes into fewer, larger
 * notes at the same address. This helps reduce wallet fragmentation and improves transaction
 * performance by reducing the number of notes that need to be processed in future transactions.
 * 
 * The consolidation process:
 * 1. Identifies all notes at the specified Sapling address
 * 2. Groups them into batches (respecting maxNotes and maxTransactions limits)
 * 3. Creates consolidation transactions that spend multiple small notes and create one larger note
 * 4. Uses intelligent note selection to optimize for fee coverage and batch efficiency

/**
 * @class AsyncRPCOperation_saplingconsolidation_address
 * @brief Asynchronous operation for consolidating Sapling notes at a specific address
 * 
 * This class implements an asynchronous RPC operation that consolidates multiple Sapling notes
 * at a given address into fewer, larger notes. The operation runs in the background and can
 * be monitored using the standard async RPC operation status mechanisms.
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Intelligent two-step note selection algorithm (fee coverage first, then optimization)
 * - Configurable transaction and note limits to control operation scope
 * - Maintains at least one unconsolidated note for immediate spending
 * - Handles wallet locking gracefully by capturing spending keys during construction
 * - Respects network upgrade boundaries to avoid transaction expiry issues
 * 
 * Security considerations:
 * - Requires wallet to be unlocked during operation creation to extract spending keys
 * - Spending keys are held in memory only during operation execution
 * - Uses minimum confirmation depth of 11 blocks for note selection
 * - Validates all cryptographic proofs before transaction commitment
